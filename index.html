      ar[0] = "I haven't had a problem for quite a while in the way we've played. I've said that, and it sounds like I've said it. I've answered that the same way for quite a while."
      ar[1] = "That's why we are in a playoff spot. Remember, it's when they realigned the division. There's three, three and two. You're trying to stay in that three hole."
      ar[2] = "The big thing is his feet. The adjustment is clearly his feet."
      ar[3] = "Again, you guys always want to go back. I always look ahead, right? We're as close to winning as we are to losing, so that's how I deal with it."
      ar[4] = "I think every team backchecks. I mean, that's what most teams do. Play a 200-foot game."
      ar[5] = "Just count. It's just what I just said. Since the 27th or 28th of December, this'll be our 19th game. Tough sleddin'."
      ar[6] = "I'm concerned because we haven't scored lately, but I'm not concerned about how we've played, so I'm not making that big a deal of it."
      ar[7] = "Score. Score to win. Can't win nothing-nothing."
      ar[8] = "I'm not getting into philosophy."
      ar[9] = "Kind of a phantom call on Brown. One guy called hooking on Jarret, which was a penalty on Malkin, and then the penalty on Brown at the same time."
      ar[10] = "You know what? You play right away again. You've got to reset it again."
      ar[11] = "We're not worried about Crosby and Malkin."
      ar[12] = "I'm not going to lose any sleep over how we played."
      ar[13] = "Yeah, it is off. He's got seven goals in 41 games. So I'd say his scoring is off. Based on that, he's a 14-goal scorer. That's not enough, right?"
      ar[14] = "I don't want to talk about it. Talk about the team. One guy doesn't win games."
      ar[15] = "The defending Stanley Cup champion just kicked our ass."
      ar[16] = "I don't think our team ever really struggles with confidence. I mean, it doesn't really matter what the score is. I don't think confidence is an issue for our team."
      ar[17] = "What is that? [If the Kings score within the last minute of the second period, then everybody gets a McDonalds McFlurry.] That's a good thing, I guess. A free dessert. I'd rather have lemon meringue pie, myself."
      ar[18] = "On Robyn Regehr's toughness: He's just flat out tough."
      ar[19] = "I saw the same thing you guys did, and that was the last time I saw him, and then I just saw him with his street clothes, like, figuratively a minute ago."
      ar[20] = "I think I was in the barn…I wasn’t shoveling shit, I remember that, but I had that day. Was probably warming up. It was cold."
      ar[21] = "I guess I don’t get to see the cows for a while."
      ar[22] = "This isn’t baseball."
      ar[23] = "They can wear wigs and sunglasses. I don’t care, as long as they’re ready."
      ar[24] = "He has a sore back. It’s that old line. 'I’ve got a weak back.' 'When did it happen?' 'About a weak back.'"
      ar[25] = "Nobody died, and it’s a hard-working point for our team."
      ar[26] = "(I)t's tough to make the first pass when your friggin' (butt) is up in the air, from getting knocked on it."
      ar[27] = "Heck, when I first went there, our captain lived in Edmonton in the summer and their captain lived in Calgary. Where was the rivalry? You’ve got tougher traffic than me?"
      ar[28] = "I'm not a philosopher or Nostradamus or nothing."
      ar[29] = "They haven't lost at home since Christ was a child."
      ar[30] = "I told him I need tires for my tractor. Hey, it might mean the difference of two or three minutes in a game."
      ar[31] = "I just fold my pajamas, and that's it. … We played an afternoon game and lost 1-0 Columbus or somebody. It was a pajama party."
      ar[32] = "When I steal their ties, I tell them they've got $800 ties on, and $300 suits."
      ar[33] = "There was a lot of contact when he was out there. Boom. Jeez."
      ar[34] = "Where did my team go? Olympics? What's that? Russia?!? They are not in our conference. Why did the team go there?"
      ar[35] = "When you score five goals on the road, you should win a game. What do you mean, am I happy?"
      ar[36] = "We're trying to make the playoffs. I'm not a philosopher. We're trying to make the playoffs, and so are they."
      ar[37] = "No, I think that I wouldn't call it 'wide open.' I would call it 'errors.'"
      ar[38] = "(On whether momentum can transfer from the third period into Game 2) Yeah. That's why they call it a series, Jon."
      ar[39] = "We'll play better tomorrow. It's not like there was a death in the family or something"
      ar[40] = "We won't go away quietly."
      ar[41] = "Supposed to be a fast track in the Kentucky Derby. Bet on California Chrome."
      ar[42] = "[On what Greene brings]: A lot of what Willie brings, except he shoots right."
      ar[43] = "[On the key to shutting down Anaheim’s top line]: Hit and hope."
      ar[44] = "[On how the travel is different from the first round series]: Anaheim’s closer than San Jose. You can drive 40 minutes, and the other one, we flew it."
      ar[45] = "I can’t remember much about the San Jose series."
      ar[46] = "Luck? You can't manage luck. And I’m not managing, I’m coaching."
      ar[47] = "On the decision to use Jordan Weal in the shootout: Tanner Pearson told me to, so I did. You do what you’re told."
