ar[0] = "I haven't had a problem for quite a while in the way we've played. I've said that, and it sounds like I've said it. I've answered that the same way for quite a while."
ar[1] = "That's why we are in a playoff spot. Remember, it's when they realigned the division. There's three, three and two. You're trying to stay in that three hole."
ar[2] = "The big thing is his feet. The adjustment is clearly his feet."
ar[3] = "Again, you guys always want to go back. I always look ahead, right? We're as close to winning as we are to losing, so that's how I deal with it."
ar[4] = "I think every team backchecks. I mean, that's what most teams do. Play a 200-foot game."
ar[5] = "Just count. It's just what I just said. Since the 27th or 28th of December, this'll be our 19th game. Tough sleddin'."
ar[6] = "I'm concerned because we haven't scored lately, but I'm not concerned about how we've played, so I'm not making that big a deal of it."
ar[7] = "Score. Score to win. Can't win nothing-nothing."
ar[8] = "I'm not getting into philosophy."
ar[9] = "Kind of a phantom call on Brown. One guy called hooking on Jarret, which was a penalty on Malkin, and then the penalty on Brown at the same time."
ar[10] = "You know what? You play right away again. You've got to reset it again."
ar[11] = "We're not worried about Crosby and Malkin."
ar[12] = "I'm not going to lose any sleep over how we played."
ar[13] = "Yeah, it is off. He's got seven goals in 41 games. So I'd say his scoring is off. Based on that, he's a 14-goal scorer. That's not enough, right?"
ar[14] = "I don't want to talk about it. Talk about the team. One guy doesn't win games."
ar[15] = "The defending Stanley Cup champion just kicked our ass."
ar[16] = "I don't think our team ever really struggles with confidence. I mean, it doesn't really matter what the score is. I don't think confidence is an issue for our team."
ar[17] = "What is that? [If the Kings score within the last minute of the second period, then everybody gets a McDonalds McFlurry.] That's a good thing, I guess. A free dessert. I'd rather have lemon meringue pie, myself."
ar[18] = "On Robyn Regehr's toughness: He's just flat out tough."
ar[19] = "I saw the same thing you guys did, and that was the last time I saw him, and then I just saw him with his street clothes, like, figuratively a minute ago."
